## Contributing

When creating pull requests where you add commands, make sure they work with my commands system. In stead of the `@commands.command()` decorator, use `@commandExtra(category="my category")`. \

When picking the category, look at other commands in the cog and pick the existing category where it would fit best. \

*You may run a **private instance** to test your changes (do note that existing commands will not work due to the language files not being on github. You may also have to make some changes to the imports in order for it to work).*
